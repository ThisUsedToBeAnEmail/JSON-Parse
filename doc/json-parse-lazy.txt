Scan the string for the start and end of objects, arrays, strings,
object keys, and other values.

Return object $json

Given a request for $json->{x}->{y}, look through the top object's
keys for key "x". If it cannot be found, return undef. Then get the
value corresponding to x if it's found, then y. Then take the start
and end points of that and actually parse them into an SV and return
the SV as well as storing it.
